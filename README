When creating our source files to accomplish this task, we saw a lot of similarities between 
k-anonymity and l-diversity and therefore we formed our algorithms within the same file, as 
they use the same data structures and other methods.

By the time we realized we were meant to separate them, it would have required a lot of refactoring. 
As such, we have labeled a majority of the methods within the Table_generalizer.java file with the 
appropriate prefixes to help identify which belong to which. That source file should be the only file 
where the algorithm dependent methods are, so Data_table.java and main.java are just the 
data structure used, and the runner for the program. 

We hope this is satisfactory and apologize for the inconvenience in file naming convention.
